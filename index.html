    </header>
    <p>Hello, there! My name is Emma Knight. I am an upcoming web developer in the computer science realm and I have
      decided to share with you some of the extracurricular hobbies I have picked up over the years. Of course, I have
      had
      many other interests in the past, but these are the ones that have stuck with me throughout the years. I hope you
      enjoy and learn something new!</p>
