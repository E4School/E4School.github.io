1)  Maybe keep the color scheme the same for continuity

2)  I would also add a way to tell what page you are currently on. 
Like on the homepage, the "Home" text in your navigation bar could be a different color or surrounded in 
a box to indicate "you are on this page." This can help with the website's usability.



The first change I made according to my peer's recommendations was background continuity across pages. 
I changed the backgrounds for all of the pages (except the ugly page) to be a blue gradient.

The second change I made according to my peer's recommendations was making sure the users know which page they 
are on by marking the current site with a box rim.
